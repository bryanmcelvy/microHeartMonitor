# μHeartMonitor: An ECG-based Heart Rate Monitor

An electrocardiogram-based heart rate monitor project implemented with a TM4C123 microcontroller and custom analog front-end circuitry. Please read below for more information on what exactly this project is and why I decided to do it!

## To-do
### Hardware
* Design a custom PCB
* Add electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection
* Replace most of the op-amps in the AFE circuitry with an AFE IC (e.g. AD8232)
### Software
* Rework the structure of/relationship between the LCD and ILI9341 modules
* Refactor ADC module to be more general
* Refactor SPI module to be more general
* Remove statically-allocated data structures for unused Timers and GPIO ports
* Add remaining parts of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm
  * Thresholding procedure for bandpass-filtered signal (not just integrated signal)
  * Search-back procedure
  * T-wave discrimination
* Add heart rate variability (HRV)
* Move CMSIS-DSP filters from DAQ and QRS modules to their own module
