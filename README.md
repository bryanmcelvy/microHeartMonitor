# μHeartMonitor: An ECG-based Heart Rate Monitor

An electrocardiogram-based heart rate monitor project implemented with a TM4C123 microcontroller and custom analog front-end circuitry. Please read below for more information on what exactly this project is and why I decided to do it!

## Summary

### What is this?
μHeartMonitor is a personal project that I made to increase my experience in embedded software engineering and apply my previous coursework in biomedical engineering. Essentially, it's a fully-functional, ECG-based heart rate monitor that runs on the popular Tiva LaunchPad evaluation kit for the TM4C123 microcontroller.

### How does it work?
An electrocardiogram (or ECG) is a plot of the electrical activity of the heart over time. The hardware in this project senses a patient's ECG signal and transmits it to the microcontroller circuit. The microcontroller receives, processes, and analyzes this signal to determine the average heart rate throughout the previous 5 seconds of monitoring time. It also displays both the waveform and the heart rate to a liquid crystal display (LCD).

### How is this repository organized?
The [Navigation](#navigating-the-repository) section goes into a bit more detail, but the vast majority of the project-specific source code is within the [`/src`](/src) directory. [`main.c`](/src/main.c) is the primary script for the project that is loaded on the microcontroller and implements the heart monitor. The other folders in `/src` host different modules (i.e. collections of `*.c` and `*.h` files) that each implement a particular aspect of the project.

The [`/docs`](/docs/) directory hosts the project's [reference manual](/docs/refman.pdf), the diagrams explained later in this `README`, and external resources.

The project is primarily built using CMake, which generates Makefiles based on the commands in each of the different `CMakeLists.txt` files present in many of the directories.

### Why'd you do all of this?
***Short version***: Because I was interested in doing it and saw utility in doing so.

***Long version***: See the "Motivation" subsection in the documentation.
